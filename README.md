# Why this Repo
This Repo contains various works, that indicate the importance of Time-Series data and further discuss about the endless applicaton of Time-Series analysis of data. Here I collect all monumnetal works on Time-Series analysis over the web, concatenate them, and present for better learning of students like me. I also update recent advancements of the domain.
  ### Target User
  - A student of Machine Learning (might be an absolute beginner).
  - Someone, new in this domain.
  - Researchers, working on Time Series Data.
  - Enthusiasts of the domain, who want to know about recent advancements.
  - Kagglers!! 
  
  
# Introduction
  - [Time Series Modelling](https://medium.com/@ATavgen/time-series-modelling-a9bf4f467687) is a great introductory article to start 
    the journey. Avery good introduction of Time-Series analysis is presented here. This article helps to have a clear understanding of
    the need of Time-Series analysis.
  - [This Beautiful article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/everything-time-series-analysis-components-data-saranya-anandh) introduces
    component of Time-Series modelling like seasonal effect, irregularity in data, trend analysis to the readers. It also talkks about
    goals, needs of Time-Series data to a deeper extent.

# Tutorials (in Python)
  - [A comprehensive beginnerâ€™s guide to create a Time Series Forecast](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/) is a very good place to kickstart one's first Time-Series project. This article gets into the useful analysises
    of Time-Series data, in a lucid manner.
  - [7 methods to perform Time-Series Analysis](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/02/time-series-forecasting-methods/) is another
    good introductory material on Time-Series. Here, the components of Time-Series data like Simple-Average, Moving-Average, ARIMA etc. 
    is discussed in a proper way with suitable amount of mathematical explanation and visualization.
  - [Part 1: Time series analysis in Python](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-9-time-series-analysis-in-python-a270cb05e0b3) is the Part 1 of Open Machine Learning course provided by Dmitriy Sergeev. This article is bit         involved. An in-depth analysis, accompannied by ready-to-use coding, is performed in this course. In short, this course brings
    more seriousness in the topic. 
  - [CO2 emission forecast with sessional ARIMA](https://www.kaggle.com/berhag/co2-emission-forecast-with-python-seasonal-arima)
    does a comprehensive analysis of CO2 emission, which is nothing but a Time-series data and develops model using sessional ARIMA. 
    The work is quite good and involved with a good amount of interactive plots to understand the significance of the analysis.
    


# Tutorials (in R)
  - [1. A Complete Tutorial on Time Series Modeling in R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/12/complete-tutorial-time-series-modeling/) includes in depth discussions on time series, using R. It contains a lot of examples on different usability of Time-Series       data.
  - [This Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/wiki-traffic-forecast-exploration-wtf-eda) is one of the best kernels written
    in R.
